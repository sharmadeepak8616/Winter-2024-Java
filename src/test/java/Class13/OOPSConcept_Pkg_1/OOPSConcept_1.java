     * OOP Concept:
     *
     * 1. Encapsulation:
     *      Wrapping up the code in a class.
     *      To implement/practice Encapsulation concept, we create Class and write code in it.
     *
     * 2. Abstraction:
     *      Hiding unnecessary information from user.
     *      To implement/practice Abstraction concept, we create methods.
     *
     * 3. Inheritance
     *      -> To implement/practice Inheritance, we create parent-child relation between two classes.
     *      -> to create parent-child relation between two classes, we use "extends" keyword with Child-Class.
     *      -> childClass can access parentClass methods and variable as well.
     *      -> a childClass can extend ONLY one class (why?)
     *
     * 4. Polymorphism
     *
