     * Limitations of Array:
     * 1. In order of create an Array, we have to know either
     *      a) what are the values which you want to store in the array
     *          or,
     *      b) how many values you want to store in the array
     *      Collections allows us to create a new collections even if we don't have above information.
     *
     * 2. Array length is fixed.
     *      Collections expand/contract as we add/remove values.
     *
     * 3. Array can store multiple value but ONLY of same datatype
     *      Collections can store one or more values of multiple datatypes.
     *
     * --> Collection (ArrayList) can be used instead Array to overcome the limitations of Array.
